I like to build and design fun solutions and experiences!

More about me! 👀
* I love motorsports like F1, WEC and WRC - wanna talk technical, historical or downright chaotic about them? I'm the guy for that!
* I love to talk about different cuisines, where they come from or where do they get their names. And better yet I love to eat!
* Quite a anime and TV series fan with violet evergarden and Reacher(2022) as among my favourites!
